# Java_DSA

In this repo you will find the most coonly used Codes for Java DSA which will include Sorting searchinga and etc.

DSA is Data structure and algorith which is used by dveloper to develop and softwares 
mainly we will focus on Time and Space Complexity.

Time Complexity: Time complexity is defined as the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of the length of the input.
Space Complexity: The space complexity of an algorithm or a computer program is the amount of memory space required to solve an instance of the computational problem as a function of characteristics of the input.
